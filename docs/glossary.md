| **Kerberos** | A network authentication protocol pioneered by MIT. This is the most common authentication protocol in big data and is supported by DT RTS. |
| **Kubernetes** | An open source container orchestration software backed by Google. In 2017 Amazon and Azure picked up kubernetes enabling it to be some day de-facto orchestration software for cloud. |
| **Log Aggregation** | The process of aggregating distributed logs in one place. In a distributed application, the processes write logs to local hard disk. Thus logs of an application are distributed and hence it is very time consuming to debug a distributed application. Aggregating logs in one place saves time to debug. |
| **Logical Plan**   | Logical representation of an Apex application, where the computational nodes are called _Operators_ and the data-flow edges are called _Streams_. |
| **Loose Coupling** | Ability to loosely couple parts (operators or micro data services) to get them to serve a particular function as a whole. In this architecture the interaction is via a message bus. Loose coupling helps reduce time to value and maintenance cost by enabling parts of an application to be upgraded/modified without touching the rest. |
| **Message Bus** | A logical infrastructure component that enables a publisher to publish data. Consumers, also called subscribers, subscribe to topics or queues. Message bus is a core concept behind loosely creating application(s) from loosely coupled micro data services. Bufferserver is an example of a message bus within an Apex application. |
| **Metrics** | Operational insights need metadata of the application or cluster to be available. These collection of numbers are expressed as **metrics**. Metrics are of two types, namely application metrics that give operational insight into application data and system metrics that gives operational insights into the system data. For example,  application data is the number of phone calls successfully processed in a one hour period. System data is the system memory, tuples per second etc. |
| **Micro Data Service** | A collection of operators that provide a specific function. Usually this function by itself is not sufficient to get a complete business outcome. |
| **Multi Grid Application** | An application that is created by connecting micro data services running on different grids. |

This application is designed to ingest, transform, analyze, act, and visualize data as soon as it is generated; thereby, preventing fraud transactions in real-time. This fraud prevention [solution](https://www.datatorrent.com/fraud-prevention/) processes each record through a series of business rules and triggers one or more actions. |
| **Online Analytics Service (OAS)** | Engine for OLAP. Druid APIs are used in DT application which helps to deliver fast data analytics to our customers to enable them to achieve business outcomes. |
| **On-Prem** | Short form for **On Premise** which is within a customer&#39;s premise as opposed to in the cloud. |
| **Operators** | Operators are basic building blocks of an Apex application. An application may consist of one or more operators each of which define some logical operation to be done on the tuples arriving at the operator. These operators are connected together using streams. |
| **Output Operator** | Output operators are endpoints in an Apex application. It writes the data out to external system. |
| **Output Port** | The port through which an operator emits tuples to a downstream operator&#39;s input port via a stream. |
| **Partitioning** | Partitioning is a mechanism to eliminate bottlenecks in your application and increase throughput. If an operator is performing a resource intensive operation, it risks becoming a bottleneck as the rate of incoming tuples increases. One way to cope is to replicate the operator as many times as necessary so that the load is evenly distributed across the replicas, thus eliminating the bottleneck. This technique assumes that your cluster has adequate resources (CPU, memory and network bandwidth) to support all the replicas. |
| **Physical Operator**   | Physical instance of an operator, which contains information such as the name of the container and the Hadoop node where operator instance is running. |
| **Physical Plan** | Logical plan is transformed into a physical plan by applying partitioning attributes to the logical plan. This is a precursor to the creation of an execution plan. |
| **PMML** | [PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html) stands for &quot;Predictive Model Markup Language&quot;. PMML allows for different statistical and data mining tools to speak the same language. The structure of the models is described by an XML Schema. One or more mining models can be contained in a PMML document. |
| **PMML Scoring Operator** | DataTorrent RTS provides a scoring operator which takes XML file as input. This file contains the PMML model trained via any third-party tool and exported to PMML. The scoring operator currently supports Naive Bayes classification, SVM classification and K-Means clustering algorithms. |
| **Port**   | Each operator can have port/s on which it can receive or emit data to and from other operators. Input operator does not have input port and Output operator does not have output port. |
| **Production Grid (cluster)** | A grid used to run production applications or micro data services. This application(s) constitute the product from which business outcomes are achieved. Production grids have very tight SLA. Direct launches to production grid are very infrequent. |
| **QA Grid (cluster)** | A grid used to certify applications or micro data services for production. This grid is characterized by a looser SLA. Launches are less frequent as they mimic launch to production. QA launch is usually done as a precursor to production launch. |
| **Recovery Window ID**   | Identifier of the last computational window at which the operator state was checkpointed into HDFS. |
| **Resource Manager** | Main component of YARN that allocates and arbitrates the resources such as CPU, Memory and Network. Manages all the distributed resources in the cluster. Resource manager works with per-node Node Managers (NMs) and per-application Application Masters (AMs) |
| **Schema** | A method used to give structure to data. Big data applications almost always collect unstructured data. Assigning schemas are among the first tasks needed in the process of converting unstructured data to structured data. |
| **Schema Repository** | A repository to manage and maintain all schemas being used by the Enterprise. A schema repository may be shared by different applications. |
| **Security** | Ability to secure data. There are two main parts of security, namely (a) authenticating users, (b) specifying and enforcing authorization of access. |
| **StrAM** | Streaming Application Manager is the first process that is activated upon application launch. It orchestrates the deployment, management, and monitoring of the Apex applications throughout their lifecycle. |
| **Stream** |  A stream consists of data and control tuples that flow from an output port of an operator to an input port of another. It is a connector (edge) abstraction and a fundamental building block of the platform. |
| **Stream Modes/Stream Locality** | Streams have four modes, namely in-line, in-node, in-rack, and other. They are defined as follows: **THREAD\_LOCAL**: In the same thread, uses thread stack (intra-thread). This mode can only be used for a downstream operator which has only one input port connected. This is also called in-line.  **CONTAINER\_LOCAL**: In the same container (intra-process). This is also called in-container. **NODE\_LOCAL**: In the same Hadoop node (inter processes, skips NIC). This is also called in-node.  **RACK\_LOCAL**: On nodes in the same rack. This is also called in-rack. **Unspecified**: This could be anywhere within the cluster |
| **Streaming Application** | An application that is run on a streaming engine. |
| **Streaming Container / Container** | A streaming container is a process that runs a part of the application business logic. It is a container deployed on a node in the grid. The part of business logic is implemented via an operator. Multiple operators connected together make up the complete application and hence there are multiple streaming containers in an application.  |
| **System Metrics** | Data for operational insights into the system performance of the application. This data conveys how the resources used by the application are performing. They provide valuable insights to DevOps and data engineers. |
| **TCO** | Total cost of ownership of any project incurred by the customer. In DataTorrent&#39;s case it relates to total cost of ownership of a fast big data analytics application. This cost includes cost of development, testing, launching, and equally (or more importantly) cost of ongoing operations. Cost includes salary, hardware, etc. aka all costs are to be accounted for. |
| **TTV** | Time to value of any project. This is the time it takes for a customer to successfully go from inception to getting value out of a project. |
| **YARN** |   [Apache Hadoop YARN ](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current2/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a cluster resource management technology, introduced with Hadoop 2.0. |
| **Window ID**   | The sequentially increasing identifier of a specific computation period within an Apex engine. |
